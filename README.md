# Advent of Code 2017
Because I'm a computing educator, I don't write code every day. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it. So when I heard about [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) late 2017, I knew I wanted to participate.

I wasn't too interested in the competition aspect, knowing I couldn't be up at midnight every night working on code. Instead, I decided to commit to solving the problems as close to when they came out as I could for my circumstances. I also decided to use Ruby so I could remember the basics I used to know from working in Rails for half a year, and learn about the language on its own a bit more deeply.

I managed to solve almost all the problems the day they came out, with just two or three being finished the day after due to time constraints (read: two young children). I also learned a lot about Ruby, from the unexpected things you can do with hashes to its memory model, and more.

This is the code as I wrote it â€“ no editing after the fact. I know I'm not following all the Ruby conventions (I really do prefer camel case for example), and I'm probably being more verbose than a lot of folks doing this competition (I love readable code).

Now that the competition is over, you can [see all the problem descriptions](http://adventofcode.com/2017/) to understand what I'm trying to achieve.
